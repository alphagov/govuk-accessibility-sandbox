      <h2 class="heading-medium">What is it?</h2>

      <p>The pattern is a list of headings each with a description and some hidden content. When you select the heading
        or the description the hidden content is revealed.  There is also a button to open and close all the content.
      </p>

      <p>The pattern allows users to see a summary of available content which can then be expanded if a user want to read more.</p>
