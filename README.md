# Accessibility Sandbox

A place to build and view components with accessibility in mind and get feedback from the community and beyond.


#### Install dependencies

Open a command line app (Terminal on OSX) and change to the unzipped directory. Then run:

```
npm install
```

This will install extra code that the prototype kit needs.

#### Run the app

```
npm start
```

Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
